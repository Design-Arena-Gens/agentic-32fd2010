# Proteus 8 Logic Circuit Guide

A single-page reference for assembling and validating AND/OR logic circuits in Proteus 8. The site highlights component selection, schematic wiring, simulation tips, and export guidance, and includes an interactive truth-table simulator that mirrors gate behavior.

## 📋 Description

Use the instructions to build a dual-gate circuit in Proteus 8 with shared inputs, LED indicators, and proper power routing. Toggle the virtual inputs on the page to preview the exact logic levels you should observe during simulation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Any modern desktop or mobile browser

### Usage

No build step is required. Open `index.html` directly or serve the directory with any static file server.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── index.html      # Main page markup
├── styles.css      # Visual design
├── script.js       # Truth-table simulator logic
└── vercel.json     # Deployment configuration
```

## 🎨 Features

- Step-by-step Proteus 8 schematic walkthrough
- Component checklist and wiring best practices
- Interactive AND/OR simulator with LED-style feedback
- Responsive layout optimized for lab environments

## 🔧 Customization Ideas

- Extend the simulator (`script.js`) with extra gates (XOR, NAND) or sequential logic.
- Swap LED visuals with SVG drawings that match your lab documentation.
- Translate the text inside `index.html` for bilingual instruction sets.
